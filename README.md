# PatchOrganizer
Patch organizer helper utility for Hotone Ampero(c) and Ampero One multieffect presets files.

This is PatchOrganizer, a small tool that will help you organize your Ampero(c) presets files on your Mac or Windows computer.

# What's inside the files?

The source code:

## For MacOS

All Swift code was created to handle the C code that manipulates the PRST files.
<br/>You need XCode on your MacOS to develop and compile the app.

## For Windows

The equivalent C++ code was created using Qt6 community edition (Qt Creator). See http://qt.io for more info, or to download Qt.

## Common files

Two C files are needed:
<br/>patchorg.h -> header file
<br/>patchorg.c -> tools to manipulate the PRST files

# I just want to use the software!
